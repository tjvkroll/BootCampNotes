Jira:

Jira is a ticketing system that allows teams to manage and share the status of work as well as a mechanism to protitieze that work. This helps create transparency into all work executed by a delivery team, resulting in:

- A single point of truth for all work done by a team
- No hidden or untracked work
- High alignment and updates between team members on the work in progress
- Ownership of all the work by the team
- Allows leaders to see what is happening without distracting teams members

Features:

- Backlog: Prioritized list of tickets to be reviewed, refined, and readied ot bring into the sprint
- Kanban Boards: Single plane of glass for current work in progress.
- Ticket Status: Provide real-time conversation and associate commits, and build history with each ticket, along with ongoing comments and status updates.

There are 4 stages that a ticket, or task, can be in:

- To DO
- In Progress
- To Demo(review)
- Done

As a team member moves the task from stage to stage, they can alter settings to notify their team, or comment on events that have taken place pertaining to their ticket. It is critical to constantly be updating and commenting on your tickets; the transparency to your teamates will keep everything running more smoothly.
