Version Control:

A version control system (also referred to as Source Code Management) is the foundation for Continuous Integration. It allows teams to iterate quickly and release more frequently by being able to work on code changes in isolation and then merge in their changes in a way that does not interfere with other work As teams make smaller changes more frequently the ability to track changes, ensure they meet quality standards and do not conflict becomes critical. However, just using a VCS does not guarantee a team will perform better. It is important that temas also develop a source code management strateggy that mkes integrating changes to their codebase easier, faster and less error-prone.

Security Considerations:

Do NOT commit any private data to ANY repository. Even private repositories may have public contributors, or may be made public at any time. Private Keys, secrets, passwords, etc. Should all be stored securely and/or encrypted.

Git history will include a record of your change, and any sensitive information wil require rewritting of history to fully remove. Overwriting history is necessary for security, but avoiding it in the first place is greatly preferred.
