How does the private subnet IP address of your computer and the public Internet IP address relate to each other? How does traffic get routed from the Internet to your computer?
The public IP address identifies you to the wider internet so that all the info I search for can get to me while the private IP address is used withing a private network to connect securely to otehr devices within that same network. 
Traffic goes through the series of routers and gateways to the gateway associated with the public IP address we have, once there the gateway for our network uses its lookup table to send the data to my private ip address associated with my computer within the subnet.
