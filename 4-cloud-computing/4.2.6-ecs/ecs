- set up images for applications I put on ECS (i.e. docker build images)

- Pushed those images to their own repositories on aws's ECR

- created Launch template using an aws certified ecs-optimized AMI

  - In the launch template I added a script to the user data section that added an enviromental variable to the ecs-cluster config file that pointed the instance to which cluster it would be associated with.

- after creating my launch template I made and auto scaling group using the template

- In the cluster setup I selected something that started with a "C" and had the word policy after it that allowed me to link my auto scaling group to my cluster.

- This is where things get fuzzy, I had trouble linking my instance to the cluster and had to make sure I had the right AMI and userdata script.

- Once I got the instances my auto scaling group was creating to show up in the "infrastructure" tab of my cluster I moved onto the task definitions.

- This is where I defined which images were gonna be run on my instances and their specific requirements.
  - specific requirements in this case were
    - the port mappings between my api container and the ui container
    - enviromental variable in the ui container that points to the
