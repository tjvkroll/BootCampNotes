Checking out tags of a forked repo: 
    1) make sure to set the repo you forked from as your upstream, and your new forked repo as your origin
    2) Next - "git fetch upstream --tags" to get all the upstream tags
    3) Finally - "git push origin --tags" to push all the upstream's tags to your new forked repo
